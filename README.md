# ConsolePlaygroundCSharp

- Playing around with the basics of C#.
- Designed a player interface with a greeting method.
- Created a hobbit and wizard classes with name properties, constructors, and get name methods. 
- Wrote a short console app that gathers the users name, instantiates a hobbit player, greets the narrator, and then instantiates a wizard player side-kick.
